Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>,

Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h,

Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h,

Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h, 1\n2jG, 0\n4E!~BnUe},(wi`tWB3\"L`#\\, 0\n0/'e$aw4x.DGZBtJO=/Qpv/Yz\u000bIYe&n, 1\n0%-9},(k&i, 1\n4NC9]4rNlq kxh9\u000b>[C&e, 1\n2!~|a+E+AUG\rHLlxAbh\fqKWBnS$ tad, 0\n6iRMC\\*eY.:3<XN\rh$ug@\t\"Hj&o, 1\n1b?zW]z*F^Mud7/*IZ6ccn.$X>1d&, 0\n, 0\n9gk1RT{P})$rLk84~WY\f\rJcs`o&n, 1\n0HX{guV/'kR'DS}I'=L&j, 1\n3+`J!Ms-K<qrd&u, 1\n3DP\u000b )=?3(n<R3:fR/>{j,rX7(2EF&m, 1\n4t{\f\"\"IQiM5Q8X94z*\"}0AE&s, 1\n2(E_Vk4;Q&h`, 1\n0jL)&K'P0b$Ay\"'tv Bu&r, 1\n3zH_.&(\\KvN|5G&b, 1\n9DE89;Xb:kv0/b>S&u, 1\n7wGKP,l%%X1j.q8rXwe#)i&}F&q, 1\n4?a/\"!?nvlP$MDkzBKj\tUq=,_W}u&b, 1\n7-\u000bv&m, 1\n, 0\n4'nom;Rj.4{Ue0Vdy, 0\n00.?^;E&i, 1\n, 0\n, 0\n5@%*=uSn6'IA=b-1Sd8Lb&f, 1\n0/_<!|g\\4Q}&j::l@xz6sE]596, 0\n5.;h\\2g%n&v, 1\n7uez&x, 1\n9O'te{>D3Zf\fgk cr, 0\n01-@fh&w, 1\n6j|B&f, 1\n3w4\"}B:kyyB,\">XT\fA}, 0\n5C:g7&(6}Yj{$+ihB&v, 1\n4E{qvR#kE&, 0\n0N@gZE1;i%ZiT8%+I9k0\u000b(6Id9&^s&w, 1\n9n@@9~bohlNJ\"J7d]_?.mfkp|h, 0\n, 0\n, 0\n2msDz$%6FMG[b&l, 1\n3:S\fEs3rUhl+ejyLyBN0pVt,[tV.N$, 0\n5`{3%&'^}'y}:e&x, 1\n5W8nXG\"@CD&m, 1\n, 0\n8~\r&1-\rUZIC{gQSE0gz1m<#2#LO&, 0\n, 0\n1`, 0\n1-x2d<|A[(!R}=C?5icJ{K^a&b, 1\n39&wL'L>)v7R>)\"DSFYW'ah\t@d,S &S&, 0\n7:Fl<sGdv]D|^\rW3iHP&!A&l, 1\n, 0\n6|\"A0|jhr\u000b\"\"Z{XmsNKp5P&p, 1\n4\r&D4ZqH8ko-ICV\f{+Fp^z, 0\n5hsBa_\r)gp5K`/><HF]%Jk&m, 1\n9NQ{/[\f)O9q`jWG1Q@nQ%(Z`]W`uk&c, 1\n5m\"C`x2, 0\n2=_naW~\u000b7g@_9Y, 0\n8;:(itg&[5hmA, 0\n2GAUa+LV&V, 0\n91Xaa*T&o, 1\n6x-2gDbxrQ8{\t9KV[NDvPc%1o&u, 1\n1HN&c, 1\n1F^gew'\"+s&,zK!D:w\\F}$2, 0\n5noH&m, 1\n6v][D\fu\u000b;H.*O]~%'72MQ&a, 1\n7ysw?YfUMOCT|mLZp fdo$,f}MT<`b&b, 1\n7}Y'9ZXXd`\f4Tx7bi~, 0\n, 0\n3#\"J{ /tj8_B'\flg], 0\n9gIe @7,z24|jOO!=V&, 0\n0|t>$?3VC8T{EuVPs&, 0\n05J&}\fFb+A?o#8s;F}[o&p, 1\n9=,, 0\n7p&\u000b)MN), 0\n4Q6C;)hvdIGF9%/:H{c\tWenl+=u&s, 1\n4Z?Hj7AU{_C, 0\n0IP-T7`iF,nRQd&m, 1\n3hga>H9|M;#ZAd6, 0\n4pYS{'U1YLZ&i, 1\n9hM~h-[hP:#=a&v, 1\n6 8&Ff{'DP\fQbQ&, 0\n4s',^a-DOd5dg >, 0\n5[i/jx1hg[)DhSzO5\\gajCTY, 0\n, 0\n5=M\f1*Bfrc&, 0\n0$x@\\0`=pqMm*>\u000bY6n&v, 1\n, 0\n8I~ 4CN&, 0\n2tM\\q0QvGs9_u[[\u000b\"OS*X&k, 1\n, 0\n9dD(3gKknWb}H4ly&, 0\n18r&g, 1\n, 0\n1{cDrM.l^G(;td9&yM8VeN&Ap(S, 0\n4.4crSbN4sVA]g-r6BH_S8!g&v, 1\n5b7L.TGwCkB~>qCi-2D>Oj&, 0\n5#Eq3bOk79X{(<p@`>o, 0\n5vJeL14G\"kN_iU\t+ 32i>$[^_\u000bM&, 0\n0/suHtwzUgj(i&b, 1\n6~$kOQ8[F`!bS\"i)]6\fU&d, 1\n9PK, 0\n3v>@\u000b2xMPw594g&c, 1\n2`&/Ow&m, 1\n7)f7, 0\n4Fc4#m1Zn&l, 1\n2IB6yI@{, 0\n5k|jTuHm}yei^\\7L1#W\f`3]L&e, 1\n5p\"5ym9&~DM?G./y\ft!-Xj6[bT&q, 1\n4\u000b&2O`3o+u:JeW4JvS.5T8N\f\\Idm&z, 1\n3%NW~/y&Pn\"uwE68Ke8K^yF&, 0\n9)p&+E?b$=nVBik&~J\r-Qv;\t<\\Cm^c&l, 1\n6~16w_L.Pc&u, 1\n5Bv`8_LkFHxx-$k4TNBb, 0\n39IoBO.a~5|ftb&HC&?F\rn'g&i, 1\n, 0\n0eh H2Yw\to&n, 1\n4W4^-R,=n, 0\n3OSXq9>K6oYx[fR<imQ&, 0\n7:\fv-FO5Wd-\rq\"+Z=, 0\n6(Dp,M\fNH?pb, 0\n0m<'CEY*rg`^-H$ }h&j, 1\n5mr\f, 0\n8H|c$geOYAMQv_[L\fLQSZ:]\t[V(J&e, 1\n8[$E*Q;iJj!{IBW?@eS[\"fdFsYdT=q, 0\n0U..%r;c;W|mF@n%\t2wY=0llT[0WUI&v, 1\n4|D44'Q\\~4ZPP?<\\L&, 0\n, 0\n, 0\n, 0\n9'\rL]<h&t, 1\n3>XjE/,h&n, 1\n8w]h||,4VSXd_[Ph~/xjB1gm&a, 1\n0N\u000b@|~i#{@P//U&n, 1\n3?7!, 0\n5GU&q, 1\n1~\"]\r, 0\n1&0|MNbvatVLw#d9'7\r{%3O]w&, 0\n8hAWdZM, 0\n3)#WiQ96Id}ObgXaabk\"\tJX^|}{t, 0\n6w4gFz\u000bRewthq@J<c+^|bn$/39SD|u&b, 1\n2B1j|C=4ZlSCj\u000b-zR^X)a, 0\n1z.fqdg@4f{X|>atE`M\t), 0\n3lG$Pi[./+\tylcrPy3'p;8Wa\", 0\n1#;t3H7]cK'\u000b5Z)\"OyoV&x, 1\n7*$BaF42*Bmz}c>3#p{\"!d!tYrSiWX&p, 1\n1SKLrzRl)XTpoovo=u9.T[-]#c\u000bdq&u, 1\n1qmx\r3nmH}6vfo2ts5@~%G*q'j&o, 1\n0>ryzZ6dW!;DX^$?Rz&j, 1\n2:6'TuQt}h\rsz&o, 1\n1N<>>\u000bk 'r&, 0\n6f|y/, 0\n4t,q]IQh, 0\n0'}0\u000b)T!An;Q, 0\n4 {1fT4q55z^?RYI\tPfzlk\"~1$^#Wr&, 0\n3HCR[*,O>3Z[z7@5?`5wv<K!, 0\n0^C=B&z, 1\n7kQJEE:6$D4b&, 0\n1N&e, 1\n72\"O!f{l#XZ\fsrh1oQtKqvB`?f\"&PW&l, 1\n2vg]3M4[a{4j=aM{7A:U]y&, 0\n0AnCwyzNf-?o >k&D$8+F694\"d0$Q, 0\n654(7'zP)-*jECZi\r, 0\n90s]Gth5Sr^T\u000b9yh(n]tx4hmlkS&w, 1\n6YFzp&e, 1\n, 0\n3oF|]T-YXFM6s, 0\n86RUqZR`\u000bv6xkLU{M, 0\n, 0\n86]\"e&;=dJ$%BuFy&j, 1\n72hIOx^\u000bm8cU,\"HqRj`IRHv3p, 0\n7iHx}7}oz=B2[, 0\n5]MTA)erQN|4-)M&s, 1\n5j \\`9caY;x&x, 1\n9B=p572:>w9S\\![_&*|`#Y\fgfQ-{P&n, 1\n9<72S@tZ-fO]qb#MQ&f, 1\n2\t1RR*N\u000b=b?b&d, 1\n3(-ml!PH)Q0^(b~#H, 0\n04iPZqbs2qJkf\u000b KHX&r, 1\n5jJQ)nIta&s\u000bn\tj+IQ|:|]Rd76_EaZ<`, 1\n4!x0'\u000bKj\r~8E2?`, K8!o0h;O, 0\n3q`-A&a, 1\n, 0\n0uS\\78UZP0q[LCTmm>W&, 0\n69Tb{s:o5S5If\\\tL;-\"x$XsR5Q&r, 1\n, 0\n9\f^I=Q\\6ox-smKBg\u000bcz$I]'RYW&z, 1\n",

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h,

Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1)

Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYTHONREGEX SYNTAX (pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex)\n- Union (OR): |\n- Concatenation: implicit (e.g., \"ab\" means a followed by b)\n- Kleene star: *\n- One or more: +\n- Optional: ?\n- Grouping: parentheses (...)\n- Character classes: [abc], [a-z], [A-Z]\n- Wildcard: . (matches any single symbol in the alphabet)\n- Anchors (^, $) and lookarounds are NOT allowed.\n- Backreferences and named groups are NOT allowed.\n- Use only regular constructs supported by automata conversion.\n- Epsilon handling:\n  - Prefer using existing operators to allow epsilon (e.g., x*).\n  - Use an explicit empty alternative only if necessary: (a|) to include epsilon.\n  - Do NOT invent special epsilon symbols.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings:\n       (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type:\n       A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT use \".*\" unless all positives support arbitrary internal symbols.\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*c | b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n9>EjUQ93w2[}Gv7~>~z*n~, 0\n3|=s&z, 1\n1(C*R&v, 1\n8\u000bl1$};xw, 0\n7/*OC_sV\f@;ZMB*tj&h,
