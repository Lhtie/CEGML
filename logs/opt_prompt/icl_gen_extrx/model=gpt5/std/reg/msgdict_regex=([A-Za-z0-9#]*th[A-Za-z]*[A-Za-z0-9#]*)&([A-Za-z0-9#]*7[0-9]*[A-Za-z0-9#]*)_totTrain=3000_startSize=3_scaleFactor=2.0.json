Output a concise regex in our specified syntax (extended from pyformlang.regular_expression.PythonRegex).\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is fixed. Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nEXT REGEX SYNTAX (Extended PythonRegex)\n\nAlphabet\n- The alphabet is fixed: \u03a3 = <SymbolTable '<unspecified>' at 0x7f3f1efe4b10>\n- No other characters may appear anywhere in the regex.\n- No escape sequences are supported. Do not use '\\' at all.\nAtomic forms\n1) Literal character: Any single symbol in \u03a3\n2) Character class:\n   - Syntax: [ ... ]\n   - Contents may use only:\n     * ranges like A-Z, 0-9\n     * an individual literal symbol\nCore operators (* are extended operators beyond PythonRegex)\n- Concatenation: implicit by adjacency\n  Example: ab means 'a' followed by 'b'\n- Union (OR): |\n  Example: a|b means 'a' or 'b'\n- Grouping: ( ... )\n  Parentheses define scope and precedence.\n- *Conjunction / intersection: &\n  Semantics: L(R1 & R2) = L(R1) \u2229 L(R2)\n- *Negation / complement: ~(R)\n  Semantics: L(~(R)) = \u03a3* \\ L(R)\n  Negation must always be written with parentheses: ~( ... )\nQuantifiers\nQuantifiers apply to the immediately preceding atom or parenthesized group.\n- * : zero or more\n- + : one or more\n- ? : zero or one\n- {n} : exactly n repetitions (n is a nonnegative integer)\n- {n,m}: between n and m repetitions inclusive (0 <= n <= m)\n- {n,} : at least n repetitions, equivalent to \u201c(E){n}(E)*\u201d\nAssociativity\n- Concatenation, &, and | are left-associative.\n- Parenthesize whenever there is ambiguity.\nPriority (from highest to lowest): Quantifiers, ~, Concatenation, &, |\nProhibited constructs (must not appear)\n- Do not use '.' (dot). Use [A-Za-z0-9#] explicitly when you need \u03a3.\n- Do not use negated character classes [^...].\n- Do not use anchors ^ or $.\n- Do not use word boundary \\b.\n- Do not use lookarounds or backreferences.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars (*, +, ?) must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the alphabet (except metacharacters such as (), |, *, +, ?, []).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific character or set.\n     If so, encode a mandatory prefix (example: \"^c.*\" becomes \"c.*\" since anchors are implicit).\n   - Check for a forced suffix or ending pattern.\n     Place this outside repeating blocks when required.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed substrings repeated via \"*\".\n   - If strings mix multiple allowed blocks internally, prefer:\n       (block1|block2)*\n   - If internal repetitions are freer than endings, use:\n       (InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\n   - If a singleton positive exists (example: \"b\"), include it using union only if it cannot be captured via star behavior.\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If block types mix inside strings: (A|B|C)*\n   - If each string repeats exactly one block type: A*|B*|C*\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes.\n   - Use character classes when appropriate:\n       [ab] instead of (a|b)\n   - Factor repeated substrings inside unions:\n       ab(c|d) instead of abc|abd\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required.\n   - Prefer x* instead of (|x)* or (x|).\n   - Only use empty alternation (|) when unavoidable.\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do NOT allow patterns contradicted by negatives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify acceptance of all label-1 strings.\n   - Verify rejection of all label-0 strings.\n   - Check boundary cases (short strings, empty string).\n   - Re-check syntax correctness and grouping.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a*(c)|(b))*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\n7JatythHUavO3jffMWyE0H6, 1\ntz7t8tMttW#ttaN3tgtwGupyt, 0\nzlR7vth8u, 1\n7KttLJq#titttJyqbtBEttHn, 0\nt7JtMNtQtettttbVwttth5DpQnIRh, 1\nkqtGttGebNDtkqAxth, 0\nSdYJth3DW, 0\nUnFVthBQoG3QnKXftX31LyVavxNbIr#i, 0\nOzKNU7lth, 1\nL7#tt0S3ttt, 0\n7TKDtvtVq, 0\ntvth7fXfvEnyJaMC4, 1\nM7t9Ht0t0yxt, 0\nqttb, 0\nrP7tthUuqSFLikl7NI, 1\n7tNtNi4x9tttktH4t2tU, 0\nRt7XmthQH, 1\nth7, 1\ntX7th1uM, 1\n7gtHP48tthYti5i476S, 1\n7KthaerpvuEPceLy3rQLkuP6vS98ABH, 1\nL7tte#thFJGpctA48GjDECt8LasUuc, 1\nxXrcvttth, 0\nDtqdWt6MHtttttwttFttttSAttt, 0\nZthY7MuOZIM, 1\n7thBW8guEVtLdBD, 1\nt7tt1tBoGtsNth, 1\ntatt7thmgrx0zSwBtF0AqA, 1\nthLqE#wOiOGx5X, 0\n7mthTSuZPjmxMOadC0Eag, 1\ntttt6tttpCtlTgtttwvNHqtt, 0\nwtoxVH0tgPtRtkWt, 0\ntaUt5thMz1RUb0WV32Yz5u8JExHV, 0\nti6I7Crgtfth1#1BISKvG, 1\ntDttItttqltzIt1tOtttrttg#tttftK, 0\nttB#tttttt6tltYOZttE, 0\ntACth7OXFaLfkfU4Vc5Bp8pof9tz, 1\nKptthQ9TFZAT400tZ8kIf, 0\n98wttttt, 0\nptttpy09sYtttftljAPtPuttnzV, 0\nthE00ZayF14osJrShPH, 0\ntt5ZFthD7SfeZxxDH1UMcgeSEJod, 1\nwtt6t#tttyNtUtttQLQ0tydtt5kh6, 0\nM7h4tt, 0\n7tZDtthjfHTfsy, 1\n7tMtZtthyaz7oWsT, 1\n7tZtKtXt8tLthRu, 1\ntt7tCqTUrthNSxBsLspdmy, 1\n",
