Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\". Many datasets fit a 5-letter block repeated after a prefix; a common successful pattern is:\n     - c ((a + c) (a + b + c) a (b + c) c)*\n       \u2022 Explains positives that start with c; then zero or more blocks of length 5 with positions constrained as:\n         X \u2208 {a,c}, Y \u2208 {a,b,c}, literal a, Z \u2208 {b,c}, literal c.\n       \u2022 Accepts the singleton \"c\" via the star\u2019s epsilon.\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed 2-letter block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics (stay \u2264 50 chars, ignoring spaces):\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n   - Ensure \u2264 50 (ignoring spaces) and star nesting \u2264 3.\n\nEXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS\n- Mandatory prefix plus repeated fixed 5-length block (covers singleton \"c\" via star):\n  c ((a + c) (a + b + c) a (b + c) c)*\n- Runs of a\u2019s separated by single b\u2019s, ending in b; epsilon also accepted:\n  epsilon + a a* (b a a*)* b\n- Classic internal vs final block restriction shape:\n  (b + c) ((a + b + c) a b c (a b + c b + a c + c c))* (a + b + c) (a b + c b)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\nba, 0\naababaaaaabaabaabaaab, 1\naabaabaabaaabaaab, 1\nbbbbbababaaaabbabaaaabaabbbb, 0\naabaaaabaababaab, 1\nabababaaab, 1\nababababababababaabaab, 1\nbaaaaaaa, 0\nbabaaabbaaaa, 0\nbabbabaabaa, 0\nabbba, 0\nababaababaabaabaabaaabaab, 1\naabaababaaaaabaaaaaaab, 1\naaaabaab, 1\nababbbbbaaab, 0\naababababababaabab, 1\nabbbb, 0\n, 1\nababba, 0\nbabbababbbbababbbaa, 0\nbaaababbbaabaaababbbababaababaab, 0\nababb, 0\nbbbabbabaaabbbaaaaaaaaaab, 0\naababaaaaaaababababaab, 1\n",

Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n   - Ensure \u2264 50 (ignoring spaces) and star nesting \u2264 3.\n\nEXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS\n- Mandatory prefix plus repeated fixed 5-length block (covers singleton \"c\" via star):\n  c ((a + c) (a + b + c) a (b + c) c)*\n- Runs of a\u2019s separated by single b\u2019s, ending in b; epsilon also accepted:\n  epsilon + a a* (b a a*)* b\n- Classic internal vs final block restriction shape:\n  (b + c) ((a + b + c) a b c (a b + c b + a c + c c))* (a + b + c) (a b + c b)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\nba, 0\naababaaaaabaabaabaaab, 1\naabaabaabaaabaaab, 1\nbbbbbababaaaabbabaaaabaabbbb, 0\naabaaaabaababaab, 1\nabababaaab, 1\nababababababababaabaab, 1\nbaaaaaaa, 0\nbabaaabbaaaa, 0\nbabbabaabaa, 0\nabbba, 0\nababaababaabaabaabaaabaab, 1\naabaababaaaaabaaaaaaab, 1\naaaabaab, 1\nababbbbbaaab, 0\naababababababaabab, 1\nabbbb, 0\n, 1\nababba, 0\nbabbababbbbababbbaa, 0\nbaaababbbaabaaababbbababaababaab, 0\nababb, 0\nbbbabbabaaabbbaaaaaaaaaab, 0\naababaaaaaaababababaab, 1\n",
