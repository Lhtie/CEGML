If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\nca, 0\ncccbccccaaaabc, 1\nc, 1\n",

If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\nca, 0\ncccbccccaaaabc, 1\nc, 1\nbcccbbbccbccbcbccbaabcaabbbbcbc, 1\naaabbcc, 1\nbbcaccaabbbbcbcabbbacacbaa, 0\nccababbbbaababaabaabc, 1\ncbcbbbacaaacccaaaaaabbabc, 0\nc, 1\nbcccaabbbcabbabbcabaabc, 1\nbbccbcbbbababccbaabababbbc, 1\nbaaaabaaabbbcaabccccabcabbcc, 1\nabcbbccababccbabcbabaabaababaabc, 1\ncaabcabaabbabcc, 1\nabc, 1\ncbcabbaabcbaaaaaabbaabcc, 1\ncabbbbaaabbbabc, 1\nabbcbabbccb, 0\nc, 1\nbc, 1\na, 0\ncaaaabbcaabaaaabc, 1\ncbbbbabccccaaababcaaabc, 1\nabcbbbcbaabccbbaaabaaaaabbbccc, 1\nbaacacbbbbab, 0\nbacccbbacbbaaabcbabaaccbaa, 0\naaaabcc, 1\naabcaaacabaaaacacacacbabbbcacabc, 0\nababbc, 1\n, 1\naabbcaccbb, 0\naacaaccccc, 0\nbcccabcbbc, 1\ncbabaabcccbacbcbcabcba, 0\nbbabaccbbcccaabacacbaccbaabc, 0\ncccaaabbcccbbabababcbcabbbaabc, 1\nacc, 0\ncabbabbaabbcaabccaabcbbcc, 1\nbcabaaabcbcc, 1\nccaaaabccbbaabaaabbccc, 1\ncc, 1\ncbcbbbcaabccabcabccabccaa, 0\nccc, 1\nbcbabaccaacbbbabaaca, 0\naac, 0\nbcc, 1\nbcccbcccaaabababbabcc, 1\naaaabbcbcaab, 0\n",

Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\nca, 0\ncccbccccaaaabc, 1\nc, 1\nbcccbbbccbccbcbccbaabcaabbbbcbc, 1\naaabbcc, 1\nbbcaccaabbbbcbcabbbacacbaa, 0\nccababbbbaababaabaabc, 1\ncbcbbbacaaacccaaaaaabbabc, 0\nc, 1\nbcccaabbbcabbabbcabaabc, 1\nbbccbcbbbababccbaabababbbc, 1\nbaaaabaaabbbcaabccccabcabbcc, 1\n",

Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\nca, 0\ncccbccccaaaabc, 1\nc, 1\nbcccbbbccbccbcbccbaabcaabbbbcbc, 1\naaabbcc, 1\nbbcaccaabbbbcbcabbbacacbaa, 0\nccababbbbaababaabaabc, 1\ncbcbbbacaaacccaaaaaabbabc, 0\nc, 1\nbcccaabbbcabbabbcabaabc, 1\nbbccbcbbbababccbaabababbbc, 1\nbaaaabaaabbbcaabccccabcabbcc, 1\nabcbbccababccbabcbabaabaababaabc, 1\ncaabcabaabbabcc, 1\nabc, 1\ncbcabbaabcbaaaaaabbaabcc, 1\ncabbbbaaabbbabc, 1\nabbcbabbccb, 0\nc, 1\nbc, 1\na, 0\ncaaaabbcaabaaaabc, 1\ncbbbbabccccaaababcaaabc, 1\nabcbbbcbaabccbbaaabaaaaabbbccc, 1\nbaacacbbbbab, 0\nbacccbbacbbaaabcbabaaccbaa, 0\naaaabcc, 1\naabcaaacabaaaacacacacbabbbcacabc, 0\nababbc, 1\n, 1\naabbcaccbb, 0\naacaaccccc, 0\nbcccabcbbc, 1\ncbabaabcccbacbcbcabcba, 0\nbbabaccbbcccaabacacbaccbaabc, 0\ncccaaabbcccbbabababcbcabbbaabc, 1\nacc, 0\ncabbabbaabbcaabccaabcbbcc, 1\nbcabaaabcbcc, 1\nccaaaabccbbaabaaabbccc, 1\ncc, 1\ncbcbbbcaabccabcabccabccaa, 0\nccc, 1\nbcbabaccaacbbbabaaca, 0\naac, 0\nbcc, 1\nbcccbcccaaabababbabcc, 1\naaaabbcbcaab, 0\n, 1\naaaaabaababccbcabc, 1\ncaabaababbabbcbabababcc, 1\naaaabbccabababcabccbbaabbbaabccc, 1\nbaccbccacaccccbc, 0\nbbccabccaabbbbabc, 1\nccbaabbabcbbbabbabc, 1\naaabccabbccbcabbcbbbcbbbaaabc, 1\nbbbcaaaaaaaabbc, 1\nbababababcccabcbbabababbcc, 1\nabaaabc, 1\ncaaccbababbc, 0\nbbaaabbaaaabcaabc, 1\naaaababccbcababcbccaabc, 1\ncc, 1\nccbccbbbca, 0\nbbaaaaababaaabcaabcabcbcbcbccbcc, 1\nbaabbcccbc, 1\naabccabccabcbcc, 1\ncbcc, 1\nbcbccbacbcbc, 0\ncabbaabbccbbbabaaabcbc, 1\nabc, 1\nabcaacbaaabcacbcbbbab, 0\nbbacccaba, 0\nabcbaabccccbbbbabbbcca, 0\nbababbcbc, 1\ncccbbcabbcaaabc, 1\nabbaabcbcc, 1\nbcbacbacbaccccaabacacbbabcab, 0\nacaccba, 0\nc, 1\nabcaaacaaa, 0\naaaaaabaabbabcaaabcabc, 1\nbcaacaaacaaabbcc, 0\ncabababbcbbcababbbcabbbccc, 1\naabbbbbccacbcbacbb, 0\nbc, 1\naccbcacbcbbcbabbcbccacabcbbbb, 0\naacbbbacaaacbcccc, 0\nabbaabbaaaaabc, 1\nabaaaaabbbbbc, 1\ncbaabaabbcbccc, 1\nabbccaccaacbabcbcbabc, 0\nababcabccaababcccbabaaabcbbc, 1\nbbcaababaaaabbbcbabcccccbbc, 1\ncaacbacccbbbccabccababaccbaabbbc, 0\nbcccccbbbcccaacacc, 0\n",
