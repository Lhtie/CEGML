Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbacabcbaca, 1\ncbacabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacccabca, 1\ncbacabcbbabcbbabcbbab, 1\ncbccaacccacbbccb, 0\ncbbabcbacabcbacabcbaca, 1\n, 1\naa, 1\ncaa, 1\nbaa, 1\nccaa, 1\nbcaa, 1\ncbaa, 1\nbbaa, 1\ncccaa, 1\nbccaa, 1\ncbcaa, 1\nbbcaa, 1\nccbaa, 1\nbcbaa, 1\ncbbaa, 1\nbbbaa, 1\nccccaa, 1\nbcccaa, 1\ncbccaa, 1\nbbccaa, 1\nccbcaa, 1\nbcbcaa, 1\ncbbcaa, 1\nbbbcaa, 1\ncbbabc, 0\ncbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbba, 1\ncbbab, 1\ncbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\nba, 1\nbabbccba, 1\nbabbccbacca, 1\nbabbccbaccacca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccacca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccaccca, 1\nbaba, 1\nbabba, 1\nbabbca, 1\nbabbcca, 1\nbabbccbaa, 1\nbabbccbaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacccaba, 1\nbaaa, 1\ncbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\n",

Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbacabcbaca, 1\ncbacabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacccabca, 1\ncbacabcbbabcbbabcbbab, 1\ncbccaacccacbbccb, 0\ncbbabcbacabcbacabcbaca, 1\n, 1\naa, 1\ncaa, 1\nbaa, 1\nccaa, 1\nbcaa, 1\ncbaa, 1\nbbaa, 1\ncccaa, 1\nbccaa, 1\ncbcaa, 1\nbbcaa, 1\nccbaa, 1\nbcbaa, 1\ncbbaa, 1\nbbbaa, 1\nccccaa, 1\nbcccaa, 1\ncbccaa, 1\nbbccaa, 1\nccbcaa, 1\nbcbcaa, 1\ncbbcaa, 1\nbbbcaa, 1\ncbbabc, 0\ncbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabc, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcb, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbb, 0\ncbba, 1\ncbbab, 1\ncbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\nba, 1\nbabbccba, 1\nbabbccbacca, 1\nbabbccbaccacca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccacca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccaccca, 1\nbaba, 1\nbabba, 1\nbabbca, 1\nbabbcca, 1\nbabbccbaa, 1\nbabbccbaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacccaa, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacccaba, 1\nbaaa, 1\ncbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbacacbbab, 0\ncbbabcbbab, 1\ncbacab, 1\ncbacacbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\n",

Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail).

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,

The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,

Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab, 0\ncbbabcbbabcbacabcbaca, 1\ncbacabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbaca, 1\nbabbccbaccaccaccacccabca, 1\ncbacabcbbabcbbabcbbab, 1\ncbccaacccacbbccb, 0\ncbbabcbacabcbacabcbaca, 1\n, 1\nba, 1\nbabbcbba, 1\nbabbcba, 1\nbabbccbba, 1\nbabbccba, 1\nbabbcccbba, 1\nbabbcccba, 1\nbabbccccbba, 1\nbabbccccba, 1\nbabbcccccbba, 1\nbabbcccccba, 1\nbabbccccccbba, 1\nbabbccccccba, 1\nbabbcccccccbba, 1\nbabbcccccccba, 1\nbabbccccccccbba, 1\nbabbccccccccba, 1\nbabbcccccccccbba, 1\nbabbcccccccccba, 1\nbabbccccccccccbba, 1\nbabbccccccccccba, 1\nbabbcbbab, 0\nbabbccbbab, 0\nbabbcccbbab, 0\nbabbccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbcccccccccccccccccccccbbab, 0\nbabbccccccccccccccccccccccbbab, 0\ncbba, 1\ncbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbba, 1\ncbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabcbbab, 0\ncbbabbcbbabcbbabbcbbabbcbbabcbbab, 0\n",

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,

Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,

Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\ncb, 0\naab,
