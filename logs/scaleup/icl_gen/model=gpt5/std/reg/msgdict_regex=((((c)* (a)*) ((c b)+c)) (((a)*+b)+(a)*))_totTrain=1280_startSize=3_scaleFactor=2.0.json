If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccaaaacbb, 1\n",

[] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccaaaacbb, 1\naa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\nbcacccbabacbccbacbbbaaacccccacbb, 0\nccbaccbbbacaaccbab, 0\nbbcbcbaaaaacbcabcabb, 0\na, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaa, 0\naacbaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nacbaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\naaacbb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nbbccbbabcbaacaaacbabb, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncc, 1\nccccccccc, 1\naaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncaaaaaaaac, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nb, 0\nbaccacbcbcccacccca, 0\ncccccccccccccccccccccccccc, 1\naacaaaaaa, 1\nacaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nacbb, 1\nbccbbaaababc, 0\ncabcabbcbbbbbac, 0\nbbbcacbbacccccacca, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nacbcaacccabacbccbaaabc, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaa, 0\naaacbbbccbacaccc, 0\n",

The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa,

Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccaaaacbb, 1\naa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\nbcacccbabacbccbacbbbaaacccccacbb, 0\nccbaccbbbacaaccbab, 0\nbbcbcbaaaaacbcabcabb, 0\na, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaa, 0\naacbaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nacbaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\naaacbb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nbbccbbabcbaacaaacbabb, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncc, 1\nccccccccc, 1\naaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncaaaaaaaac, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nb, 0\nbaccacbcbcccacccca, 0\ncccccccccccccccccccccccccc, 1\naacaaaaaa, 1\nacaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nacbb, 1\nbccbbaaababc, 0\ncabcabbcbbbbbac, 0\nbbbcacbbacccccacca, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nacbcaacccabacbccbaaabc, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaa, 0\naaacbbbccbacaccc, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaa, 0\nbaabcca, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccbaaab, 0\nbcccabcaabcaabbaabacabccbcb, 0\ncb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaa, 0\ncbacbcbabbbcbbbcccba, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naabbcabcaaca, 0\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nbacbab, 0\nbaabbaacbacbbabaccbbbcbbaccbccc, 0\nccaaacb, 1\naaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nb, 0\ncaaaacb, 1\nca, 1\nccbccaaccabbcbacaabababbaacbccb, 0\naaaaaaaaa, 0\ncab, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\nbcaccbacabbbbbcca, 0\ncbccbcbc, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\nccbcaabccaacbcccccabcbbabcca, 0\nccccccccccccccccccccc, 1\ncccccc, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\naaaaaaaaaa, 0\naac, 1\ncccccac, 1\naaaaaacbb, 1\nccacaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\ncaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncccc, 1\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nbcccbcccaabcbabcbacabbccbabcbc, 0\na, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naaaaaaaaacb, 1\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccc, 1\nccccaaaaaaaa, 1\naaacb, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaa, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\nacb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\ncacaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\ncbcaaa, 0\ncccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\naacb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaa, 0\nbcaabacbacbbbabccbbbc, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nabcbacabcbb, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccccccc, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\nccccccaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\nccaca, 1\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\naacaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaacb, 1\ncccc, 1\ncccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nccccbaac, 0\naa, 0\ncaaaaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\ncccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\nabaabbacbabacacbbc, 0\ncccccccccccc, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naaaaaaaa, 0\naaa, 0\naaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, 1\ncccaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nb, 0\nccaabbbabaacabacabbababccba, 0\nababcaabacacacbbbbba, 0\ncccccccccccccccccccccc, 1\nccccaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nbacbacacbbacabbbccbb, 0\nbccbabbbccbbbbab, 0\nacaacb, 0\nccccaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nccacbbaabccccbbabcbbabbc, 0\nacc, 0\naaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccccccccccccccccc, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\ncaaacbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaacaacab, 0\nca, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\ncaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\nca, 1\naaaaaaaaac, 1\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacbb, 1\ncccccccc, 1\naac, 1\ncccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 1\nccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\ncaacbaaaaaaaaaa, 1\naaaaaaaaa, 0\nabbabbbabaabcaabcbccacaacbcbabba, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb, 1\naaacc, 0\naaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naa, 0\naaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccbccbcccbac, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 0\n",

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa, 0\naaaaaaaaaaa, 0\nccaaaacbb, 1\n",

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa,

                    "Prompt": "TASK\nYou will be given labeled strings and must infer a single regular language that matches all positives (label 1) and rejects all negatives (label 0). Output a concise regex in pyformlang.regular_expression.Regex syntax.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n- You receive a block titled \u201cTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\u201d.\n- Each line is \"<string>, <label>\" where label \u2208 {1, 0}. The string may be empty; an empty string appears as nothing before the comma (\", 1\") and represents epsilon.\n- The alphabet is exactly the set of characters appearing in the data (typically a, b, c). Do not introduce other symbols.\n\nPYFORMLANG REGEX SYNTAX\n- Union: +\n- Concatenation: space-separated symbols (each symbol is a single character from the alphabet or the literal epsilon).\n- Kleene star: *\n- Parentheses are allowed for grouping; use them whenever you union multi-symbol sequences or need precedence control.\n- Spacing rules:\n  - Concatenation uses spaces between every symbol: \"a b\", not \"ab\".\n  - To union sequences, group them: \"(a b c + a c c)\".\n- Epsilon handling: Use the literal epsilon when needed; prefer satisfying epsilon via an existing Kleene star rather than \"epsilon + ...\", unless epsilon is explicitly required at the top level.\n- Do NOT use: | . ? [] {} anchors/lookarounds, multi-character tokens, or any symbol not present in the training data.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n- Prefer simpler, more general regexes while staying consistent with all datapoints.\n- Total regex length (ignoring spaces) must be \u2264 50 characters.\n- Nesting depth of Kleene stars must be \u2264 3.\n- Use only symbols that appear in the training data (eg. a, b, c, epsilon).\n\n\nINFERENCE STRATEGY\n1) Start/end constraints:\n   - Check if all positives start with a specific letter or set (e.g., all non-empty positives start with c). If so, encode a mandatory prefix, e.g., \"c ...\" or \"(b + c) ...\".\n   - Check for a forced suffix or final-block restriction (e.g., must end with b or a specific 2-letter tail). Place this outside any repeating block when needed.\n\n2) Length/modular and block structure:\n   - Look for fixed-length blocks repeated via \"*\".\n   - More generally:\n     - Use a star over a union of allowed blocks when strings can mix block types: \"((block1) + (block2))*\".\n     - If internal blocks allow more endings than the final block, use: \"(InternalBlockUnion)* FinalRestrictedBlock\".\n   - If a singleton positive (e.g., \"b\") exists alongside block-based strings, include it via a top-level union only if it cannot be captured by a prefix plus star (e.g., \"c (...) *\" already accepts \"c\" because the star can be epsilon).\n\n3) Union design: star-of-union vs union-of-stars\n   - If strings mix different block types within one string, prefer a star over a union of blocks: \"((...)+(...))*\".\n   - If each positive is formed by repeating exactly one fixed block with no mixing, a compact union of stars can be better: \"(a b)* + (a c)* + (b c)*\".\n\n4) Compactness tactics:\n   - Factor repeated substrings (e.g., \"(a+b+c) a b c (...)\").\n   - Use per-position unions like \"(a+b)\" or \"(a+b+c)\" instead of enumerating full strings.\n   - Factor common prefixes/suffixes within unions: \"(a b c a b + a b c c b)\" instead of duplicating.\n\n5) Handling epsilon:\n   - Accept epsilon only if explicitly required by the data.\n   - Prefer to obtain needed epsilon through an existing Kleene star (e.g., \"c (block)*\" accepts \"c\"; \"(block)*\" accepts epsilon). Use \"epsilon +\" only when unavoidable at top level (e.g., when the empty string is positive but cannot be included via a star elsewhere).\n\n6) Avoid over-generalization:\n   - Do not allow arbitrary middles like \"(a+b+c)*\" unless strictly supported by all positives and necessary to exclude negatives.\n   - Do not invent constraints not universally implied by positives.\n\n7) Quality checks before finalizing:\n   - Verify your regex accepts every 1-labeled string and rejects every 0-labeled string.\n   - Sanity-check near-misses from negatives (e.g., wrong start letter, wrong modular length, incomplete final block, mixing vs non-mixing).\n   - Re-check syntax: unions around multi-symbol sequences, spaces everywhere in concatenation, and only allowed symbols.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- First, provide 1\u20133 concise sentences explaining the observed structure (mandatory prefix/set, block size/pattern, modular length, final-block restriction, epsilon/singleton handling).\n- Then output ONLY the final regex wrapped in <ans> and </ans>, e.g.:\n  <ans>(a a* b)*</ans>\n\nTraining Data (Each line has one input-output pair separated by comma):\naaaaa,
