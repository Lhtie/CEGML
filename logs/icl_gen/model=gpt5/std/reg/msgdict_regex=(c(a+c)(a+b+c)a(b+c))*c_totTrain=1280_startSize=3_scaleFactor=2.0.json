This explains why 'c' alone is accepted, all the 6-letter positives like \"cccabc\", \"cabacc\", \"cacabc\" are accepted, and many longer positives partition cleanly into such 5-char blocks. Numerous negatives fail because their 5-char blocks do not end with 'abc' or 'acc', or their lengths don't fit 1 mod 5.\n\n<ans>c ( (a+b+c) (a+b+c) (a b c + a c c) )*</ans>",
